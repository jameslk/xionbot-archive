# XionBot

XionBot was an IRC bot written in C modeled from another popular application back in the day called Eggdrop. It was my
first major programming project and the biggest codebase I ever wrote in C. Eventually, I also integrated PHP (!) as a
scripting language for the bot that could be used to program its behavior without changing the C code. It was open for
extension and closed to modification before I even knew what that meant!

This was originally hosted on Sourceforge, which unfortunately, appears to be all but dead. I am keeping it on Github
for fun trips down memory lane. I wouldn't suggest using this code for anything other than to learn about the
programming behaviors of a 15 year old back in 2005.
